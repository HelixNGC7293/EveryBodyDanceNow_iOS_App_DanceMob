#### What We Have Done:
* Converted OpenPose Caffe models to PyTorch Models with [MMdnn](https://github.com/Microsoft/MMdnn)
* Converted Caffe/PyTorch to CoreML models with [CoreMLTools](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/converting_trained_models_to_core_ml)
* Shrunk size of detectors and generators significantly
* Deployed both CoreML models in an iOS app
